# Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Use the built-in scripts to install and start the repository right away. This runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
